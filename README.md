1. Open the Project
	•	Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

2. Install Dependencies
	•	Open the integrated terminal in VS Code.
	•	Run the following command to install required dependencies: npm install

3. Start the Server
	•	Finally, start the development server by running: npm  start or npm run dev 
A local server will start, and you will see a link (usually http://localhost:3000). Click the link to view the application in your browser.
